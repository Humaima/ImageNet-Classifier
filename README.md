![thumbnail_svg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/665b2404-a9c0-44c3-98a2-88e29806548b)

A lightweight and user-friendly image classification tool powered by MobileNet pre-trained on ImageNet. This project provides a simple interface to classify images with beautiful result displays.

## üìã Features

- Pre-trained MobileNet Model: Utilizes the MobileNet architecture pre-trained on ImageNet for efficient image classification
- Beautiful UI: Displays prediction results in an aesthetically pleasing gradient card
- Simple Integration: Easily incorporate into existing Jupyter notebooks or Python applications
- Fast Performance: Optimized for quick predictions on standard hardware

## Full API

- The project provides three main functions:
```bash
preprocess_image(path)
```
- Loads, resizes, and preprocesses an image for MobileNet input.
```bash
predict_image_class(img_array)
```
- Uses MobileNet to classify the preprocessed image and returns a formatted prediction string.
```bash
show_prediction_result(label)
```
- Displays the prediction result in a beautiful gradient card with interactive buttons.


## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

 1. Add support for image upload via URL
 2. Implement batch processing for multiple images
 3. Create a standalone web application version
 4. Add more visualization options for prediction confidence
